# Rendering Demos
This page is for showcasing my UCL computer graphics courseworks including ray-tracing, path tracing, and rasterization written in OpenGL. </br></br>
Specifically, the implementation includes:
* Path tracing: bouncing lights, physically-correct Phong, Halton sampling, anti-aliasing, importance sampling, and motion blurs.
*	Ray-tracing: defining geometry, computing ray intersections, casting shadows, reflections, refractions, and Fresnel.
*	Rasterization: Projection, clipping, rasterization, interpolation, z-buffering, texturing, and antialiasing.
